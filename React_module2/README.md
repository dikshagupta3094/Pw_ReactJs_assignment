# Instagram Login and Sign Up page
## In this project I have created a instagram login and signup page UI with the help of React js. This project helped me to clarify react concept like props and conditional rendering

# Approach
## Project setup 
   ### Installed vite react using command 
    npm create vite@latest
   
## Create Component folder
   ### Inside component folder create two folders named as SigUp.jsx and SignIn.jsx

## Conditional rendering
  ### import both the component in App.jsx file and use useState hook for state managment and render the component on the basis of condition using conditionall rendering 


# Steps to run application locally
 ###  Install vite using command 
    npm create vite@latest
 ###  Give appropriate folder name
 ###  Select framework React.js (use arrow key)
 ###  select Variant Javascript (use arrow key)
 ###  Run the following command
    cd folder_name
    npm install
    npm run dev
